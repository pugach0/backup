## Watch notes
*My limiting belief: I'm weak, I couldn't do this*
 What it costed me in the past to have this belief: breakdowns during competitions, super negative competitions mindset, failure.

What it costs for me now: anxiety about competitions, despair about life and rowing.

What will it cost for me in the future: regret for leaving rowing, lack of friends, problems with self-esteem, weakness, depression.

Default thoughts: competition, quiting rowing, pain
